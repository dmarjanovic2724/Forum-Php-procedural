To use this project, you need to have server with php and mysql installed. I used XAMPP stack.

Configure MySQL by creating a database with the user that have all privileges on it.
Place all project files in the server's html folder.
Modify conn.php file, by updating serverName, userName, db, password and port variables (if necessary), then run the createTables.php, that file will create necessary SQL tables on its own..

Run the project by enter url of your server and (optionally) adding `/index.php`.
